# Setup

## Build

First, install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org). On Debian or Ubuntu, simply run `apt install ffmpeg`. Then, clone and build the project using the following steps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/RedditDownloaderBot
cd RedditDownloaderBot
go build ./cmd/RedditDownloaderBot/
```

## Obtain Reddit Token

To use the bot, you will need Reddit and Telegram tokens. Start by creating a Reddit application. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and click on “are you a developer? create an app...” Choose a name, select `script` as the type of application, input something in the redirect URI field, and click on “create app.”

</p>

You will be given two tokens: a client ID and a client secret—as shown in the image below.

## Obtain Telegram Token

Interact with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create a bot and obtain its token. Additionally, you can use this [guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token).

Your token will look something like this:

```bash
4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc
```

## Run

Now that you have the necessary tokens, edit the docker-compose.yml file and set the environment variables as such:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID=p-jcoLKBynTLew
export CLIENT_SECRET=gko_LXELoV07ZBNUXrvWZfzE3aI
export BOT_TOKEN=1234567:4TT8bAc8GHUspu3ERYn-KGcvsvGB9u_n4ddy
```

You can run the bot using docker-compose. In case you don’t have docker-compose installed, follow the steps below.

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Lastly, run `docker-compose up --build` inside the RedditDownloaderBot directory to build and run the bot.

# Optional Settings

## Allowed Users

You can configure the bot to allow access to only a group of users. This is useful for deploying private bots. To do so, you need to create a whitelist that consists of Telegram user IDs. You can obtain user IDs using [GetIDs Bot](https://t.me/getidsbot). Next, create the environment variable `ALLOWED_USERS` and set its value to user IDs, separated by a comma.

```bash
export ALLOWED_USERS=1,2,3
```

## Disable NSFW Content

You can keep the bot from downloading NSFW posts by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export DENY_NSFW=true
```

## Disable Post Link

The post link is included in the caption by default. You can disable it by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export DISABLE_LINK_IN_CAPTION=true
```
